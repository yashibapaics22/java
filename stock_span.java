//he stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days.
//You are given an array of length N, where ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.
//A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price on these days is less than or 
//equal to that on the ith day.
//Input Format
//First line contains integer N denoting size of the array.
//Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
